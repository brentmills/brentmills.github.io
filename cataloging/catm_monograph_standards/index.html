              <p>RECOMMENDED STANDARDS FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS – SPECIFIC TO BOOKS (MONOGRAPHS)
Developed by Cataloging Work Team, 2002; rev. 2004; rev. 2007</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
1) The chief sources of information for each field for book records are listed in AACR2R. The chief source of information for printed monographs is the title page or, if there is no title page, the source from within the publication that is used as a substitute for it.  For printed monographs published without a title page, or without a title page applying to the whole work (as in the case of some editions of the Bible and some bilingual dictionaries), use the part of the item supplying the most complete information, whether this be the cover (excluding a separate book jacket), caption, colophon, running title, or other part.  Specify the part used as a title page substitute in a note.  If no part of the item supplies data that can be used as the basis of the description, take the necessary information from any available source.  If the information traditionally given on the title page is given on facing pages or on pages on successive leaves, with or without repetition, treat those pages as the title page.</p>
<p>The prescribed source(s) of information for each area of the description of printed 
monographs is set out below.  Enclose information taken from outside the prescribed 
source(s) in square brackets.
    AREA                    PRESCRIBED SOURCES OF INFORMATION
    Title and statement of responsibility   Title page*
Edition                 Title page, other preliminaries, colophon<strong>
Publication, distribution, etc.     Title page, other preliminaries, colophon
        Physical description            The whole publication
    Series                  Series title page, monograph title page, 
cover, rest of publication
        Note                    Any source
        Standard number &amp; terms of      Any source
            availability
*Title page includes a substitute.
</strong>[Colophon: an inscription placed at the end of a book or manuscript usually with facts relative to its production; an identifying device used by a printer or a publisher]
2) Although shown for clarity, subfield |a sometimes does not show on MARC record in initial instance of use. 
3) Some subfields are repeatable and some are not. Check AACR2R if in doubt.
4) Colon space and Semicolon space precede some fields and are required formatting.  (Refer to note that follows.)
5) In some cataloging utilities subfield delimiters take the place of spaces when shown and additional spaces to meet AACR2R requirements should not be added; in other words, without subfields the space it occupied remains in the visible record.  (This is how the Sage Library System automation handles this and so the examples throughout this document follow this principle, though the punctuation section lists the AACR2R rules.)  OCLC records are an exception: when the subfield delimiters are suppressed in the display they do not leave the space they occupied behind.<br />
For example, 300 p.:|bill. ;|c25 cm. and  300 p. : |bill. ; |c25 cm. (OCLC) 
would both display as  300 p. : ill. ; 25 cm.<br />
Check out your own utility to see how they handle this.
6) The symbol | (pipe) represents the subfield delimiter in these standards. In OCLC records you see the symbol $ (dollar sign).
7) If an item is a continuation that is updated regularly (could be annually or more frequently) then attach to a bib with an “open entry” nature (serials, etc., e.g. Fodor’s).  (Refer to “Serials” for additional instructions.)</p>
<p>010 LCCN NUMBER (Optional)
Library of Congress control numbers (LCCN) (formerly called Library of Congress Card Number) are assigned by the Library of Congress and are supposed to be unique.  They are therefore one of the most important match keys when trying to detect duplicate bibliographic records.  However, publishers do not understand that LCCN are supposed to be unique.  They print the same LCCN on different editions of a work, therefore caution should be exercised in using this as a match point.</p>
<p>LCCN’s must be entered “normalized” according to one of the two formats below.  If you are using OCLC, it does the normalization for you.</p>
<p>There are two LCCN structures: structure A for numbers formed from 1898 through 2000, in which the year portion consists of two digits; and structure B for numbers formed beginning in 2001, in which the year portion consists of four digits.</p>
<p>Structure A LCCN “normalization”:
•   a lower case, left-justified, alphabetic prefix to a maximum of three characters or three blank spaces – these prefixes and leading spaces are very important and must be retained
•   two digits meaning the year in which the item was cataloged
•   a six digit, zero-filled, sequential serial number
•   a blank space
•   variable suffixes/alphabetic identifier and revision dates, preceded by slashes
•   total length should be 8 digits (plus any prefixes and/or suffixes)</p>
<p>The number in printed form may look like these:
    85-8191 agr23-452   46-8246 /MN/AC<br />
The above numbers normalized would look like these (^ represents a blank space):
    |a^^^85008191^<br />
    |aagr23000452^
    |a^^^46008246^/MN/AC</p>
<p>Structure B LCCN “normalization”:
•   a lower case, left-justified, alphabetic prefix to a maximum of two characters or two spaces
•   four digits meaning the year in which the item was cataloged
•   a six digit, zero-filled, sequential serial number
•   total length should be 10 digits (plus any prefixes)</p>
<p>The number in printed form may look like these:
    n2001-50284     2002-378    my2001-50268
The above numbers normalized would look like these (^ represents a blank space):
    |an^2001050284
    |a^^2002000378
    |amy2001050268</p>
<p>020 ISBN NUMBER (Optional)    <br />
An ISBN is a unique number assigned to an item by its publisher.  Each ISBN number is a ten-digit number and has four parts, or a thirteen-digit number and has five parts.  If printed in a book, the four/five parts are separated by hyphens.  Enter without hyphens and add any qualifiers that describe the item.
        |a2214306080
        |a0842270884 (pbk.)
        |a9780545010221</p>
<p>Note:  Although this number is supposed to be unique, it often is not so caution should be exercised in using this as a match point.</p>
<p>040 CATALOGING SOURCE (Required)
Original source of the cataloging data (subfield |a), contributor of cataloging data, and if applicable, the modifier of cataloging data (subfield |d).  Use OCLC or USMARC code that uniquely identifies your location.  (See OCLC code list).  For example:
        |aOXU 
        |aUMT   |dLGRND</p>
<p>092 LOCALLY ASSIGNED DEWEY CALL NUMBER (Insert in item record to display in catalog)
Call numbers based on Dewey Decimal Classification.  </p>
<p>099 LOCALLY FREE-TEXT CALL NUMBER (Insert in item record to display in catalog)</p>
<p>100 MAIN ENTRY – PERSONAL NAME (Required if present)
A personal name is the name of the person responsible for the creation of the intellectual or artistic content of an item as prominently displayed.  Use of this field relates to the statement of responsibility as found following title.  For an editor, use Marc tag 700 rather than this tag.  Do not use this tag for a corporation or organization given in statement of responsibility.  Just use title entry instead and trace corporate authors in 710. (Field 110 is used for Corporate Author main entry only if document is internal corporate document.)  It is best to match names to authority files already in use.  To do this, you can search the Sage, Summit or Library of Congress databases using the author search selection for the author listed in item being cataloged.  Then select one record by author and convert to a Marc Tag display.  Fill in spelling and dates given. Use subfield |a for name, subfield |q for expanded name, and subfield |d for date, if available.</p>
<p>This field may be used only once.  Additional authors go in 700 field.</p>
<pre><code>    |aCarroll, Lewis
    |aVan Buren, Martin,|d1850-1900.
    |aWhite, T. H.|q(Terence Hanbury),|d1906-1964.
    |aJohn|bXXXIII,|cPope,|d1881-1963.

Punctuation:
</code></pre>
<p>Subfield |b is preceded by a space only
subfield |c is preceded by a comma space 
subfield |d is preceded by a comma space
subfield |q is preceded by a space only and placed in parentheses
100 field ends with a mark of punctuation or a closing parenthesis “)”</p>
<p>110     This field is used for Corporate Author main entry only if document is internal corporate document. To trace a corporate entity otherwise related to the work, generally use 610 field if subject and 710 field if not.</p>
<p>245 TITLE STATEMENT (Required)
The title statement is the title proper and may also include a general material designation (form if other than book, i.e. [text (large print)]), subtitle, other title information, and the statement of responsibility (name of author or editor).  If you need to use a general material designation, use subfield |h after subfield |a.  A list of approved designations is included in Attachment 1.</p>
<pre><code>The first indicator should be 1 if MarcTag 100 (author) is used.  Otherwise use 0.
For second indicator use 0 if title does not begin with an article.  Use 1-9 to indicate an article, plus spaces, punctuation, diacritics and underscores that precede the first significant word.

For title use subfield |a 
    245 10 |aOrigins
    245 12  |aA field guide to wildflowers
    245 14 |aThe Clan of the Cave Bear
For general material designation use subfield |h.  
    245 10 |aMathematics|h[kit]
    245 14 |aThe spirit horses|h[text (large print)]
For the subtitle use |b
    245 00 Records :|bfrom a summer day

Note:   Subfield |b follows subfield |h if used

For statement of responsibility (name of author or editor or corporation) use subfield |c.

<p>246 VARIANT TITLE (Optional) (prior to 1995, placed in 740 field).
    Examples are caption titles, spine titles, running titles.</p>
<pre><code>        Punctuation:

<p>See rules for 245 field. 
No ending punctuation is added to a 246 field. </p>
<p>250 EDITION STATEMENT (Required if applicable)
Refer to the edition statement proper and any other information up to the imprint.  Use only if the edition statement is self-defining, that is uses words such as edition, issue, version.  Numbers may appear with an edition statement. For items that use revised alone use abbreviation Rev. as in example.  If you are aware that an item is a revision but is not shown in book, you may put Rev. in square brackets per example.  Use subfield |a for edition statement
        |aEd. 1965-66.
        |a1st ed., corr. printing.
        |a3rd impression (with minor revisions).
        |aRev. ed.
