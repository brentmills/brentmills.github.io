              <p>RECOMMENDED STANDARDS FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS – SPECIFIC TO SOUND RECORDINGS
Developed by Cataloging Committee, 2004</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
1) The chief sources of information for each field for sound recordings records are listed in AACR2R. The chief source of information for each major type of sound recording  is set out here. 
        TYPE                    CHIEF SOURCE
        Disc                    Disc and label<em>
Tape (open reel-to-reel)        Reel and label
Tape cassette               Cassette and label
Tape cartridge              Cartridge and label
Roll                    Label
</em>Label means any permanently affixed paper, plastic, etc. label as opposed to the container itself, which may have data embossed or printed on it.
Treat accompanying textual material or a container as the chief source of information if
it furnishes a collective title and the parts themselves and their labels do not.  In this 
case make a note indicating the chief source of information.  If information is not 
available from the chief source, take it from the following sources (in order of 
preference):
accompanying textual material
container (e.g. sleeve, box)
other sources
Prefer textual data to sound data.  For example, if a sound disc has a label and also 
information presented in sound form on the disc, prefer the label information. </p>
<p>The prescribed source(s) of information for each area of the description of sound 
recordings is set out below.  Enclose information taken from outside the prescribed 
source(s) in square brackets.
    AREA                    PRESCRIBED SOURCES OF INFORMATION
    Title and statement of responsibility   Chief source of information
    Edition                 Chief source of information, accompanying
textual material, container
    Publication, distribution, etc.     Chief source of information, accompanying
textual material, container
        Physical description            Any source
    Series                  Chief source of information, accompanying
textual material, container
        Note                    Any source
        Standard number &amp; terms of      Any source
            availability
2) Although shown for clarity, subfield |a sometimes does not show on MARC record in initial instance of use. 
3) Some subfields are repeatable and some are not. Check AACR2R if in doubt.</p>
<p>4) Colon space and Semicolon space precede some fields and are required formatting.
5) In some cataloging utilities subfield delimiters take the place of spaces when shown and additional spaces to meet AACR2R requirements should not be added; in other words, without subfields the space it occupied remains in the visible record.  (This is how the Pioneer Library System automation handles this and so the examples throughout this document follow this principle.)  OCLC records are an exception: when the subfield delimiters are suppressed in the display they do not leave the space they occupied behind.<br />
For example,  300 p. :|bill. ;|c25 cm. and  300 p. : |bill. ; |c25 cm. (OCLC) 
would both display as  300 p. : ill. ; 25 cm.<br />
Check out your own utility to see how they handle this.
6) The symbol | (pipe) represents the subfield delimiter in these standards. In OCLC records you see the symbol $ (dollar sign).</p>
<p>020 ISBN NUMBER (Optional)    <br />
An ISBN is a unique number assigned to an item by its publisher.  Each ISBN number is a ten-digit number and has four parts.  Enter without hyphens and add any qualifiers that describe the item.
        |a1590868188
        |a1559351500 (set)</p>
<p>Note:  Although this number is supposed to be unique, it often is not, so caution should be exercised in using this as a match point.</p>
<p>024 OTHER STANDARD IDENTIFIER (Optional)
    A standard number or code published on an item which cannot be accommodated in 
    another field.  The type of standard number or code is identified in the first indicator 
    position or in subfield |2 (Source of number or code).</p>
<pre><code>1st indicator – Type of standard number or code
    0 – International Standard Recording Code (ISRC)    
    1 – Universal Product Code (UPC)
    2 – International Standard Music Number (ISMN)
    3 – International Article Number (EAN)
    4 – Serial Item and Contribution Identifier (SICI)
    7 – Source specified in subfield |2
    8 – Unspecified type of standard number or code
2nd indicator – Difference indicator
    blank – No information provided
    0 – No difference
    1 – Difference
Subfield Codes:
    |a – Standard number or code
    |c – Terms of availability
    |d – Additional codes following the standard number or code
    |z – Canceled/invalid standard number or code
    |2 – Source of number or code

    024 1_ |a5794368779
    024 3_ |a9781578155293
    024 3_ |a9780553528152|d52595
</code></pre>
<p>028 PUBLISHER NUMBER (Optional)
    The formatted number used for sound recordings, printed music, and videorecordings. 
Publisher’s numbers that are given in an unformatted form are recorded in field 500
(General Note).  A print constant identifying the kind of publisher number may be 
generated based on the value in the first indicator position.</p>
<p>1st indicator –                     2nd indicator –
Type of publisher number            Note/added entry controller
    0 – Issue number            0 – No note, no added entry
    1 – Matrix number           1 – Note, added entry
    2 – Plate number            2 – Note, no added entry
    3 – Other music number      3 – No note, added entry
    4 – Videorecording number
    5 – Other publisher number
Subfield Codes:
    |a – Publisher number
    |b – Source</p>
<pre><code>028 02 |aRH/2103|bRandom House Audio
028 00 |aBDDAP 094|bBantam Audio
</code></pre>
<p>040 CATALOGING SOURCE (Required)
Original source of the cataloging data (subfield |a), contributor of cataloging data, and if applicable, the modifier of cataloging data (subfield |d).  Use OCLC or USMARC code that uniquely identifies your location.  (See OCLC code list).  For example:
        |aOXU 
        |aUMT   |dLGRND</p>
<p>092 LOCALLY ASSIGNED DEWEY CALL NUMBER (Optional - This field does not show up on database)
Call numbers based on Dewey Decimal Classification.  </p>
<p>099 LOCALLY FREE-TEXT CALL NUMBER (Optional - This field does not show up on database)</p>
<p>100 MAIN ENTRY – PERSONAL NAME (Required if present)
A personal name is the name of the person responsible for the creation of the intellectual or artistic content of an item as prominently displayed.  Use of this field relates to the statement of responsibility as found following title.  For an editor, use Marc tag 700 rather than this tag.  Do not use this tag for a corporation or organization given in statement of responsibility.  Just use title entry instead and trace corporate authors in 710. It is best to match names to authority files already in use.  To do this, you can search the Pioneer, Orbis or Library of Congress databases using the author search selection for the author listed in item being cataloged.  Then select one record by author and convert to a Marc Tag display.  Fill in spelling and dates given. Use subfield |a for name, subfield |q for expanded name, and subfield |d for date, if available.</p>
<p>This field may be used only once.  Additional authors go in 700 field.</p>
<pre><code>    |aGrisham, John.
    |aBradbury, Ray,|d1920-
    |aLewis, C. S.|q(Clive Staples),|d1893-1963.
    |aJohn Paul|bII,|cPope,|d1920-

Punctuation:
</code></pre>
<p>Subfield |b is preceded by a space only
subfield |c is preceded by a comma space 
subfield |d is preceded by a comma space
subfield |q is preceded by a space only and placed in parentheses
100 field ends with a mark of punctuation or a closing parenthesis “)”</p>
<p>245 TITLE STATEMENT (Required)
The title statement is the title proper and may also include a general material designation (form if other than book, i.e. sound recording), subtitle, other title information, and the statement of responsibility (name of author or editor).  If you need to use a general material designation, use subfield |h after subfield |a.  A list of approved designations is included in Attachment 1 of “Recommended Standards for Bibliographic Records: Developed by Cataloging Work Team, 2002.”</p>
<pre><code>The first indicator should be 1 if MarcTag 100 (author) is used.  Otherwise use 0.
For second indicator use 0 if title does not begin with an article.  Use 1-9 to indicate an article, plus spaces, punctuation, diacritics and underscores that precede the first significant word.

For general material designation (GMD) use subfield |h.  
    245 10 |aEight cousins|h[sound recording]
    245 14 |aThe sounds of Christmas|h[sound recording]
For the subtitle use |b
    245 04 The Civil War|h[sound recording] :|bits music and its sounds

Note:   Subfield |b follows subfield |h.

For statement of responsibility (name of author or editor or corporation) use subfield |c.
</code></pre>
<p>Transcribe statements of responsibility relating to those persons or bodies credited with a 
major role in creating the intellectual content of the sound recording (e.g., as writers of
spoken words, composers of performed music, collectors of field material, producers 
having artistic and/or intellectual responsibility) in the form in which they appear.  If the 
participation of the person(s) or body (bodies) named in a statement found in the chief 
source of information goes beyond that of performance, execution, or interpretation of a 
work (as is commonly the case with “popular,” rock, and jazz music), give such a 
statement as a statement of responsibility.  If however, the participation is confined to 
performance, execution, or interpretation (as is commonly the case with “serious” or 
classical music and recorded speech), give the statement in the note area.</p>
<p>Add a word or short phrase to the statement of responsibility, in brackets, if the 
relationship between the title and the person(s) or body (bodies) named in the statement is 
not clear. </p>
<p>245 14 |aThe land that time forgot|h[sound recording] /|cby Edgar Rice 
Burroughs.
        245 10 |aEndurance|h[sound recording] :|bShackleton’s incredible voyage /|cby 
            Alfred Lansing.
        245 10 |aBorn to run|h[sound recording] /|c[written and performed by] Bruce 
            Springsteen.</p>
<pre><code>Note:  Subfield |c follows subfield |h.
</code></pre>
<p>Punctuation: 
subfield |b is preceded by space colon space
subfield |c (statement of responsibility) is preceded by space forward-slash space, each subsequent statement of responsibility is preceded by space semicolon space 
subfield |h is preceded by a space only and is enclosed in brackets. 
245 field ends with a period. </p>
<p>246 VARIANT TITLE (Optional) (prior to 1995, placed in 740 field).
    Examples are other titles, caption titles, spine titles, running titles.</p>
<pre><code>        Punctuation:
</code></pre>
<p>See rules for 245 field. 
No ending punctuation is added to a 246 field. </p>
<p>250 EDITION STATEMENT (Required if applicable)
Refer to the edition statement proper and any other information found in the prescribed sources of information (see note #1 on page 1).  Use only if the edition statement is self-defining, that is uses words such as edition, issue, version.  Numbers may appear with an edition statement.

<pre><code>The first indicator is 1 for a single surname and 3 for a family name  The second       indicator refers to subject authority on which you base the subject entry.  Use 0 for
  Library of Congress (LC) subject headings.
</code></pre>
<p>This Marc tag needs to follow LC standards. Try finding a match from the Pioneer, Orbis or Library of Congress databases. Enter names selected in the subject search in database. Try different selections until you find a possible fit.  Another way is to identify another book by the same author that has already been cataloged.  Look in the cataloged record for possible Subject Heading-Personal Name that would fit. When you have chosen a match, convert the catalog entry to a Marc Record. Enter into tag 600 exactly as you view in Marc format with the same indicators, and subfields.</p>
<p>650     SUBJECT ADDED ENTRY – TOPICAL TERM
Use for topical subject entry assigned by LC or assigned by an agency based on LC or LC Annotated Card Program (Subject Headings for Children’s Literature).  This Marc tag needs to follow LC standards. Try finding a match from the Pioneer, Orbis or Library of Congress databases. Enter words related to the subject of the book with the Subject search.  Try different words till you find a fit.  Another way is to identify another book by the same author that is similar in content and has already been cataloged.  Search for title and see if subject headings used will fit your item.  Convert chosen record to Marc Record.  Enter Marc tag indicator numbers and subfields exactly as you view them.  </p>
<p>651 SUBJECT ADDED ENTRY – GEOGRAPHIC NAME
Use for geographic subject entries actually assigned by Library of Congress Subject Headings.  This would include place names such as Yellowstone National Park or Portland (Or.).  As above, would suggest searching Pioneer, Orbis or Library of Congress databases. Search under Subject for geographic names.  If you find suitable subject entry, convert the entry to Marc Record and copy the indicators and subfields exactly as found.  </p>
<p>Punctuation: 
A period is placed at the end of the last subfield, unless it ends with a hyphen or parenthesis.
(The dashes normally shown preceding subfields v, x, y, and z are not carried in a MARC record. They are inserted by computer programs for public display of record.)</p>
<p>700 ADDED ENTRY – PERSONAL NAME  (Added title optional)
Make an added personal name entry under the heading for a prominently named editor or compiler of monographic work.  Make an added personal name entry for an illustrator if the illustrations are considered to be an important feature of the work.  Make an added personal name entry for any other name that would provide an important access point not treated in another entry. It is best to match names to authority files already in use.  To do this, you can search the Pioneer, Orbis, or Library of Congress databases. Using the author search selection choose the individual listed in item being cataloged.  Convert selected record to Marc Record and follow spelling and dates given there to fill in this Marc tag. </p>
<p>For first indicator, use 0 for a recognized forename such as Plato.  Use 1 for usual surname entries.  Use second indicator if adding a title, using 2.</p>
<p>Use subfield |a for name and use subfield |d for dates if known

Use for titles recorded in 245 subfield |b if desired.</p>
<p>Punctuation:  End field with a period unless other form of punctuation is present.</p>
<p>800 SERIES ADDED ENTRY – PERSONAL NAME/TITLE (Required if 490 1  field present)
This field is used when all books in a series are written by the same author. <br />
Follow all rules for entry of author in 100 field.
Title is added in subfield |t.  (It will be traced in online catalog).
If volume number is present it is added in subfield |v.</p>
<pre><code>    800 1  |aKaron, Jan,|d1937-|tMitford years ;|v7.
