<h3 id="cataloging-an-advanced-reader-copy-or-uncorrected-proof">Cataloging an “Advanced reader copy” or “Uncorrected proof”</h3>
<p>Advanced reader copies, uncorrected proofs, and galley proofs are generally copies released prior to publication for editing and/or reviewing proposes.  If your library should choose to add these to your collection and thus to the Sage System you need be sure to notate the record appropriately so that the bib is not used for a regular copy since sometimes pagination, dimensions, or publication information will vary.  To do this you need to invalidate the 010 and/or 020 (using subfield |z) and use the edition/history note field (500) to identify it as such.  [Don’t place the information in the 250 field, as the information is not really an edition statement.]</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>    010 __ |z9999000000
    020 __ |z9781111111111
    500 __ “Advanced reader copy”–Cover.
    500 __ “Uncorrected proof”–Cover.

<h3 id="authority-records-and-their-use-within-sage">Authority Records and their use within Sage</h3>
<p><i>(Compiled from Final Report submitted by Anne Uhl 7/20/02)</i></p>
<p>In order for the online catalog to be used to retrieve all items by a given author or on a given subject, the access points must be normalized and standardized.  Authority control is the process of determining: </p>
<ol>
<li>The form of a name, title, or subject concept that will be used as a heading in a bibliographic record </li>
<li>The cross references needed for that form.</li>
<li>The relationships between the heading and other authoritative headings. </li>
</ol>
<p>Authority work is documented in an authority record and stored in an authority file.  </p>
<p>Examples of an authority file are the Name Authority File in OCLC and the LC Authority file in DRA.  Authority files represent records of decisions made about the manner in which cataloging rules have been interpreted.  Authority headings are defined by organizations that provide officially approved terms for headings that may be used in bibliographic records.  In the United States, the Library of Congress serves as this organization.  Records for an author’s name, a subject or a title have a correct form that is established as an authority record.</p>
<p>Authority records serve two purposes: </p>
<ol>
<li>Reference source for an established heading </li>
<li>Provides guidance for the creation of a new heading </li>
</ol>
<p>Authority records are created for names, subjects, uniform titles and series.  These terms may be used in records in a database as needed or can be used to send a user to another related term with the use of see and see also cross references.</p>
<p>Authority files online</p>
<p>On July 1, 2002, the Library of Congress opened a website which lists their authority files.  This includes Name Authorities, Title Authorities and Name/Title Authorities.  It also includes authorized LC Subject Heading.  This is an important tool for catalogers. Now small sites without the large five volume set of LC Subject Headings can browse and select authorized Subject Headings.  The website is:</p>
<p><a href="http://authorities.loc.gov/">http://authorities.loc.gov/</a></p>
<p><a name="catm_cancel_control_number"></a></p>
<h3 id="cancel-control-number">Cancel Control Number</h3>
<p>Subfield z (|z) in the ISBN tag and LCCN tag is for canceled or invalid numbers.  Some systems are able to identify an invalid number in the ISBN tag when the last digit or check digit does not properly compute, thus it is an invalid ISBN number.  The Pioneer system does not identify such numbers.  An ISBN and/or a LCCN should not be listed in subfield a (|a) in more than one record.</p>
<p>If you have two or more records with the same LCCN it is easy to identify which is correct by checking the Library of Congress catalog at <a href="http://catalog.loc.gov/">http://catalog.loc.gov/</a>.  The LCCN is the Library of Congress’ control number or system number, thus any number is unique to one record at LC.  Because of this uniqueness it is one of the most important match keys for trying to detect duplicate records.  Unfortunately publishers do not understand this uniqueness and often you will find that publishers list the same LCCN in subsequent editions of books.  (Note: mass market paperbacks are never cataloged by LC.)  If you find a LCCN that is not correct but is listed in an item in hand you can list the LCCN in a bib by using subfield z (|z) to identify it as being in an item but not being correct or being invalid – thus it can still be a “match point.”</p>
<p>ISBNs are assigned by publishers and are supposed to be unique.  Unfortunately not all publishers understand this and will print the same ISBN in different editions or sometimes simply make a mistake and print it in two completely different works.  Publishers also print multiple ISBNs in items (often for different formats).  Multiple records with the same ISBN are a bit trickier than LCCNs as there is no definitive database or catalog to check these against.  If completely different records are found with the same ISBN then the safest way is to change each instance to subfield z (|z) to reflect the incorrectness of this ISBN.  [If you are cataloging an item and want to include the ISBN for other formats (e.g. large print, sound recordings, etc.) on the bib then you need to also list them as subfield z (|z) to reflect that they are not correct for this particular bib and item.]</p>
<p>It is important to also note that you made a change in a record by adding your code (e.g. OCLC code) to the 040 tag in subfield d (|d).  </p>
<p>The importance and key to correctly coding subfield z (|z) in the ISBN &amp; LCCN is for matching purposes, both by hand and by machine.</p>

<h3 id="sage-library-system-cataloging-policy">Sage Library System Cataloging Policy</h3>
<ul>
<li>approved by Sage Library System User Council , November 20, 2012</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>The Sage Library System consortium is committed to developing and coordinating a database of high-quality bibliographic records for collective use by member libraries, our library patrons and colleagues. Maintaining the quality and integrity of each bibliographic record is an interest and a responsibility shared by all member libraries. Bibliographic records added to the Sage database become the shared property of the consortium.</p>
<p>Sage Library System emphasizes voluntary and cooperative efforts to maintain database quality, accurate bibliographic  information and elimination of duplicate records. For the integrity of the database, Sage catalogers must comply with standards for full bibliographic records and perform functions only according to one’s authorized permission and certification level.
Sage Library System will make reasonable efforts to facilitate training opportunities and resources for all members. The Sage Cataloging Committee is responsible for monitoring quality assurance, coordinating regular training, and recommending measures for policy enforcement to the Sage User Council. Core guidance documents for catalogers include this Cataloging Policy, the Sage Cataloging Procedures Guide and the Sage Cataloging Manual. Only Sage certified catalogers may perform cataloging functions in the Sage Library System. In extreme cases, Sage Library System reserves the right to restrict cataloging privileges of any member library if the requirements of this policy are not met, including revocation of cataloging permissions.</p>
<h4 id="cataloging-standards">Cataloging Standards</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Requirements</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Any person performing permanent cataloging functions in the Sage Library System database must obtain prior authorization from the Sage Cataloging Committee unless operating under direct supervision of a Certified Sage Cataloger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All libraries must have someone certified at least at the “Basic” level (CAT3) in order to add items to the Sage Library System. It is advisable to have someone trained at the “Mid-level” (CAT2) so that a library is able to at least bring in some of their needed records or they must make arrangements with another library (with staff that has the appropriate level of training [CAT2 or CAT1]) to do this for them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New Sage member libraries must present cataloging qualifications to the Cataloging Committee to certify cataloging proficiency at the CAT3 “Basic” level of cataloger or higher within the first three (3) months after migration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least one person from each member library must monitor the Sage-Cat-group email list.Sage Library System Cataloging Policy</p>

<p><a name="catm_cip_records"></a>
CIP (Cataloging-in-Publication) records can be identified by these three features:</p>
<ul>
<li>encoding level (position 17) in the 000 or leader = 8</li>
<li>presence of projected publication date in 263 tag</li>
<li>300 tag with no pagination or dimensions – only “page cm.”
Additionally RDA-based records can be identified by the presence of ‡e rda in 040 field &amp; an “i” under Desc in fixed fields table.  </li>
</ul>
<p>[Note regarding transcription in RDA records:  RDA cataloging follows the principle of “Take what you see and accept what you get.” This means you should transcribe exactly what is found on the resource, &amp; accept copy in records as supplied. However, in many instances RDA gives a range of options in how fully to record information, &amp; also allows for establishing local guidelines. This means we may find that records will reflect a variety of cataloging practices &amp; still fall within the rules.]</p>
<p>These records are created prior to the publication of the materials, therefore the records contain incomplete and sometimes inaccurate information.  It is very important to verify the LCCN (tag 010 ‡a) and the ISBN (tag 020) to be sure the record matches your item.  Updating these CIP records involves several important steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add your Library code to 040 in subfield ‡d.  (See list of “040 MARC Tag - OCLC Codes sorted by…” in the Sage Cataloging Standards Manual for your library code.)  This notates who the modifying agency of the record is.  [If you are using OCLC this is done for you.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1XX tag:  Be sure the entry is accurate &amp; any 7XX fields, as well.  Also note the order of authors in the statement of responsibility (245 ‡c) as changes here affect the 1XX &amp; 7XX tags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>245 tag:  Very frequently the title proper (subfield ‡a) and/or, especially, the subtitle (subfield ‡b) changes between the time the CIP cataloging is done and the time the item is published.  There may be subtle differences that can be easily overlooked.  Please be sure to correct the title and/or subtitle according to the title page (or other preferred source of information) of the piece in hand. With RDA transcription is key, so be sure you have exactly what is on the piece in hand.  Also check the indicators for this tag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>264 tag: Compare the publication information &amp; date on the record to the piece in hand. If they aren’t the same, change the 264 field to match the piece in hand.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[MARC21 recently introduced/defined the 264 field for use with RDA-based bib records, replacing the 260 field.  The 264 statement relates to the publication, printing, distribution, issue, release, or production of a work.  Indicators &amp; subfield codes are listed below.]</p>
<p>Indicators</p>
<p>First - Sequence of statements</p>
<pre><code># [blank] - Not applicable/No information
            provided/Earliest
2 - Intervening
3 - Current/latest
</code></pre>
<p>Second - Function of entity</p>
<pre><code> 0 - Production
 1 - Publication
 2 - Distribution
 3 - Manufacture
 4 - Copyright notice date
</code></pre>
<p>Subfield Codes  R=Repeatable ; NR=Not Repeatable]</p>
<pre><code>‡a - Place of production, publication, distribution, manufacture (R)
‡b - Name of producer, publisher, distributor, manufacturer (R)
‡c - Date of production, publication, distribution, manufacture, or copyright notice (R)
‡3 - Materials specified (NR)
‡6 - Linkage (NR)
‡8 - Field link and sequence number (R)
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<p>263 tag:  Delete this tag as it contains projected publication date which is of no value to us now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>300 tag:  Add pagination information (including any preliminary pagination) in subfield ‡a, illustrative information in subfield ‡b (if applicable), and dimension information in subfield ‡c.  (Measure and input as height x width if the book is wider than it is tall; otherwise include only height.)   [Remember, if you added information in subfield ‡b, there also needs to be a code in the fixed fields for illustrations (Ills in fixed fields table) to reflect that as well.]</p>
<ul>
<li>RDA based standards are different than AACR2 in that there are no longer abbreviations used, so please spell out page, pages, leaf, leaves, volume, volumes, illustrations, etc.  Also, do not use a square bracket with the number of counted pages, instead use the counted number with the statement “unnumbered pages” or continue to use 1 volume (unpaged).  Also, cm is not considered an abbreviation in RDA but a symbol so continue to use cm for measurement as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>33X tags: 336, 337, &amp; 338 tags now take the place of GMDs and are newly defined in MARC21.  336 field is for content types (or form of communication in which the content is expressed), 337 field is for media types (or type of device required to access content), &amp; 338 field is for carrier types (or type of carrier used to convey content).  See the term and code lists on Library of Congress website for RDA Content Types at www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/rdacontent.html, RDA Media Types, at www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/rdamedia.html, &amp; RDA Carrier Types at www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/rdacarrier.html.  A regular print book would be coded similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>336 ‡atext‡2rdacontent
337 ‡aunmediated‡2rdamedia
338 ‡avolume‡2rdacarrier
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>490 tag: Does it need attention (or a companion 8XX field added, which would mean a change of 1st indicator in 490)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>504 tag:  If the bibliography note is incomplete update it with the correct pagination.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>505 tag:  Check the contents listed (if applicable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change Rec Stat code (position 5) in 000 or leader to “p” (meaning encoding level increase from CIP record) [generally this will be a “n” for new record in a CIP record].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the Encoding level code from 8 (CIP record) to a space (full level). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the abbreviation for illustrations into the fixed field for books (008 – positions 18-21, or Ills in fixed fields table).  The codes used here describe the illustrative matter of the book and correspond to the illustrations listed in the 300 tag (which will also be added).  If there are no illustrations, leave Ills in the fixed field blank.  Up to 4 single character codes can be used:</p>
<p>[blank] – no illustrations
a – illustrations
b – maps
c – portraits
d – charts
e – plans
f – plates
g – music
h – facsimilies
i – coats of arms
j – genealogical tables
k – forms
l – samples
m – phonodiscs, phonowire
o – photographs
p – illuminations </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the date in the fixed field (008 – positions 07-10 for Date1 &amp; 11-14 Date2).  This date(s) should match the publication date of the piece in hand and the date(s) entered in tag 264 ‡c.  If there is not a match, correct the fixed field date(s) and the date(s) in the 264 tag to match the date(s) of the piece in hand.  The date is a 4-digit year – no month designation included.  Also be sure to double check the country and make sure it matches 264 ‡a.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although GMDs are no longer allowed under RDA standards, until the 33X fields are usable in the ILSs the GMDs are still allowable if a library finds need of them, so please use it as needed.  [“It is recommended that the 245 subfield ‡h GMD be retained for a period of time &amp; not deleted, even though this element will eventually be replaced in function by the 336, 337, and 338 fields. The Task group recommends that the GMD be considered for removal no earlier than March 31, 2016.” -- PCC-Hybrid-Bib-Rec-Guidelines-TG-Report, p.8: www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/rda/RDA Task groups and charges/PCC-Hybrid-Bib-Rec-Guidelines-TG-Report.docx] -- If the piece in hand is a large print book add a GMD “[text (large print)]” to the 245 (see example below).  [Remember that subfield ‡h precedes subfield ‡b.]  Check to make sure the form of item in fixed field for books (008 – position 23 ; Form in fixed fields table) is coded d for large print.  In 300 tag if “(large print)” is present remove it.</p>
<pre><code>245 10 ‡aBetty‡h[text (large print)] :‡ba glad awakening /‡cBetty Ford with Chris Chase.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>[Note:  Dea Nowell at Umatilla County Special Library District uses encoding level of 1 when she updates a CIP record.  The encoding level 1 is for “Full level, material not examined.”  Dea uses this because she generally does not have the piece in hand but is relying on the information provided by the libraries that she works with.  Feel free to make corrections to the bib record if you need to and be sure to add your code to the 040 and change the encoding level as appropriate.]</p>

<h4 id="isbn-questions-and-answers">ISBN Questions and Answers</h4>
<p>revised 2007</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is an ISBN?
ISBN stands for International Standard Book Number – a unique identifier assigned to each edition of every published book and book-like product published internationally.  The ISBN was originally developed as a 10-digit number (ISBN-10).  In January 2007, the ISBN was redefined from a 10-digit (ISBN-10) to a 13-digit number (ISBN-13).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the purpose of an ISBN?
The purpose of the ISBN is to establish and identify one title or edition of a title from one specific publisher and it is unique to that edition, allowing for more efficient marketing of products by booksellers, libraries, universities, wholesalers and distributors.  [Be aware that some publishers reuse ISBN’s making them not so unique.]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How is the ISBN constructed?
An ISBN-10 consists of 10 digits and whenever it is printed it is preceded by the letters ISBN.  The 10-digit number is divided by hyphens into 4 parts of variable length.  The four parts of an ISBN are as follows: 1) Group or country identifier; 2) Publisher identifier; 3) Title identifier; 4) Check digit. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An ISBN-13 contains 13 digits which are divided into five parts of variable length, each part separated by a hyphen.  The five parts of an ISBN are as follows: 1) prefix; 2) Group or country identifier; 3) Publisher identifier; 4) Title identifier; 5) Check digit. </p>
<ul>
<li>What do the four/five parts of the ISBN mean?  </li>
<li>
<p>Prefix:  The first ISBN-13’s will be prefixed by "978".  These ISBN-13’s beginning with 978 are constructed the same way as the ISBN-10 and have an equivalent ISBN-10.  When the supply of 978 numbers is exhausted the prefix will become 979.  (There will be no ISBN-10 equivalent for the ISBN-13’s beginning with 979.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Group or Country Identifier:  This part of the ISBN identifies a national or geographic grouping of publishers that participates in the ISBN system. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publisher Identifier:  This part of the ISBN identifies the publisher to whom the ISBN was originally allocated.  Each publisher is allocated their publishing prefixes.  If they go beyond their initial title allotment they will be issued an additional publishing prefix.  Therefore, a publishing agency might carry several publishing prefixes.  Keep in mind, however, that as publishers buy and sell various imprints (subsidiaries of a publishing house) or parts of imprints, this part of the ISBN becomes less and less reliable as a way to identify the publisher of the title. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Title Identifier:  This part of the ISBN identifies a particular title or edition of a title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check Digit:  The check digit is the single digit at the end of the ISBN that ensures that each ISBN is valid, meaning that the number is correct.  The check digits are calculated based on the numbers contained within the ISBN.  (Note: Since the numbers contained within an ISBN-10 and a matching ISBN-13 are slightly different the check digits of each will almost always differ.)  A Roman numeral X is used when 10 would occur as the check digit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When should a new ISBN be issued?
A separate ISBN must be assigned to every title, or edition of a title by each publisher, but not to an unchanged impression or unchanged reprint of the same title in the same format by the same publisher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where is an ISBN located on the book?
An ISBN is printed on the lower portion of the back cover of a book above the barcode and on the copyright page.  Each format or binding must have a separate ISBN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is an ISSN?
International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is the numbering system used for serial publications.  A serial is defined as any publication issued in successive parts, usually bearing numerical or chronological designations and intended to be continued indefinitely.  Serials include periodicals, year-books, and monographic series.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can a publisher have both an ISBN and an ISSN?
Both numbering systems are used for books in a series and with annuals or biennials.  The ISBN identifies the individual book in a series or a specific year for an annual or biennial.  The ISSN identifies the ongoing series, or the ongoing annual or biennial serial.  If a publication has both, each should be printed on the copyright page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional notes about ISBNs and Millennium:
Beginning with the 2006 Release Millennium has a translator that will translate an ISBN-10 to an ISBN-13 and visa versa.  This was added as a way deal with the changeover to ISBN-13’s that began in January 2007.  (It is important to note that the ISBN-10 has no equivalent to an ISBN-13 beginning with 979 and visa versa.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently we are getting cover images of items displayed in the WebOPAC from Amazon through the use of the ISBN.  Unfortunately it only seems to work off the ISBN-10 at the current time, so in order for the cover image to show up in the WebOPAC the ISBN-10 needs to be the first listed 020.  (It is possible to move this up the list without retyping it by placing your cursor on the one you want to move and using the “Move Up” or “Move to Top of Group” found in the “Edit” menu.)</p>

<h4 id="standards-for-matching-to-database-records">STANDARDS FOR MATCHING TO DATABASE RECORDS</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developed by Cataloging Work Team, 2002</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISBN
This is a good way to search to find a possible match in the database.  Every other part of the record must then match to accept the record.  Sometimes ISBN’s may match what is in the book but the edition will still be a mismatch. Examples are: Large print books and book club editions. Then search by title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TITLE/AUTHOR
Title must match exactly up to the first five words. Also check the subtitle.  If present, it will be after the colon.  Following the forward slash is a statement of responsibility for the item.  It may be the author, an editor or a corporate body.  This name will also be listed in another tag as the author, alternate author or corporate body.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IMPRINT
This tag lists place of publication, publisher and date of publication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dates may not be the best indicator of a match because some catalogers inadvertently enter the date of printing rather than first publication date. However, if the dates do match, and the publisher is the same,  that is a good indication for matching.  If you have the item in hand, be sure you are looking at publishing date rather than date of printing.  The copyright date, if present, indicates the original date of publication, no matter what the publication date of the item in hand.  Later printings of an edition are a match; the printing date may or may not be part of the 260 field.</p>
<p>Place of publication should match if publishing dates are alike.  If there is a later printing date, the place and publisher may be different.  If that place and publisher are a subgroup of the original publisher or bought out the original publisher; and if the edition essentially comes from the same set of printing plates, such that pages are completely interchangeable between them, then it is the same edition.  If it is a completely different publisher from the same set of printing plates, this would be a different edition, noted by “Reprint.  Originally published: [place] : [Publisher] ; [date]” in the 500 field.</p>
<ul>
<li>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
If the page numbers match, great.  If they don’t, it may be due to clerical error. For example, AACR2 states that the page number listed is the last page printed in the book.  If two or three pages follow, some catalogers may incorrectly add these to the last printed page number.  If you see numbers that are very close and all other criteria match, you should assume you have a match.  If numbers vary by more than a few, you probably don’t have a match.  The best example of this, where everything is the same except the number of pages, is a book club edition put out simultaneously by the publisher(s).  These editions are smaller, the type is smaller, the number of pages is usually smaller; this means that one cannot replace a page of one with the other, and in replacement the book club edition is significantly less valuable than the trade edition.  These editions should not be placed on the same record. </li>

<p>Notes:  </p>
<ol>
<li>The chief sources of information for each field for book records are listed in AACR2R. The chief source of information for printed monographs is the title page or, if there is no title page, the source from within the publication that is used as a substitute for it.  For printed monographs published without a title page, or without a title page applying to the whole work (as in the case of some editions of the Bible and some bilingual dictionaries), use the part of the item supplying the most complete information, whether this be the cover (excluding a separate book jacket), caption, colophon, running title, or other part.  Specify the part used as a title page substitute in a note.  If no part of the item supplies data that can be used as the basis of the description, take the necessary information from any available source.  If the information traditionally given on the title page is given on facing pages or on pages on successive leaves, with or without repetition, treat those pages as the title page.</li>

<li>Although shown for clarity, subfield |a sometimes does not show on MARC record in initial instance of use. </li>
<li>Some subfields are repeatable and some are not. Check AACR2R if in doubt.</li>
<li>Colon space and Semicolon space precede some fields and are required formatting.  (Refer to note that follows.)</li>
<li>
<p>In some cataloging utilities subfield delimiters take the place of spaces when shown and additional spaces to meet AACR2R requirements should not be added; in other words, without subfields the space it occupied remains in the visible record.  (This is how the Sage Library System automation handles this and so the examples throughout this document follow this principle, though the punctuation section lists the AACR2R rules.)  OCLC records are an exception: when the subfield delimiters are suppressed in the display they do not leave the space they occupied behind.
For example:</p>
<p>300 p.:|bill. ;|c25 cm. and  300 p. : |bill. ; |c25 cm. (OCLC) </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>would both display as:  300 p. : ill. ; 25 cm.  </p>
<p>Check out your own utility to see how they handle this.</p>
<ol>
<li>The symbol | (pipe) represents the subfield delimiter in these standards. In OCLC records you see the symbol $ (dollar sign).</li>
<li>
<p>If an item is a continuation that is updated regularly (could be annually or more frequently) then attach to a bib with an “open entry” nature (serials, etc., e.g. Fodor’s).  (Refer to “Serials” for additional instructions.)</p>
</li>

<p>010   LCCN NUMBER (Optional)
Library of Congress control numbers (LCCN) (formerly called Library of Congress Card Number) are assigned by the Library of Congress and are supposed to be unique.  They are therefore one of the most important match keys when trying to detect duplicate bibliographic records.  However, publishers do not understand that LCCN are supposed to be unique.  They print the same LCCN on different editions of a work, therefore caution should be exercised in using this as a match point.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>LCCN’s must be entered “normalized” according to one of the two formats below.  If you are using OCLC, it does the normalization for you.</p>
<p>There are two LCCN structures: structure A for numbers formed from 1898 through 2000, in which the year portion consists of two digits; and structure B for numbers formed beginning in 2001, in which the year portion consists of four digits.</p>
<p>Structure A LCCN “normalization”:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lower case, left-justified, alphabetic prefix to a maximum of three characters or three blank spaces – these prefixes and leading spaces are very important and must be retained</li>
<li>two digits meaning the year in which the item was cataloged</li>
<li>a six digit, zero-filled, sequential serial number</li>
<li>a blank space</li>
<li>variable suffixes/alphabetic identifier and revision dates, preceded by slashes</li>
<li>total length should be 8 digits (plus any prefixes and/or suffixes)</li>
</ul>
<p>The number in printed form may look like these:</p>
<p>85-8191 agr23-452   46-8246 /MN/AC  </p>
<p>The above numbers normalized would look like these (^ represents a blank space):</p>
<pre><code>|a^^^85008191^  
|aagr23000452^
|a^^^46008246^/MN/AC
</code></pre>
<p>Structure B LCCN “normalization”:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lower case, left-justified, alphabetic prefix to a maximum of two characters or two spaces</li>
<li>four digits meaning the year in which the item was cataloged</li>
<li>a six digit, zero-filled, sequential serial number</li>
<li>total length should be 10 digits (plus any prefixes)</li>
</ul>
<p>The number in printed form may look like these:
    n2001-50284     2002-378    my2001-50268
The above numbers normalized would look like these (^ represents a blank space):
    |an^2001050284
    |a^^2002000378
    |amy2001050268</p>
<p>020 ISBN NUMBER (Optional)    <br />
An ISBN is a unique number assigned to an item by its publisher.  Each ISBN number is a ten-digit number and has four parts, or a thirteen-digit number and has five parts.  If printed in a book, the four/five parts are separated by hyphens.  Enter without hyphens and add any qualifiers that describe the item.
        |a2214306080
        |a0842270884 (pbk.)
        |a9780545010221</p>
<p>Note:  Although this number is supposed to be unique, it often is not so caution should be exercised in using this as a match point.</p>
<p>040 CATALOGING SOURCE (Required)
Original source of the cataloging data (subfield |a), contributor of cataloging data, and if applicable, the modifier of cataloging data (subfield |d).  Use OCLC or USMARC code that uniquely identifies your location.  (See OCLC code list).  For example:
        |aOXU 
        |aUMT   |dLGRND</p>
<p>092 LOCALLY ASSIGNED DEWEY CALL NUMBER (Insert in item record to display in catalog)
Call numbers based on Dewey Decimal Classification.  </p>
<p>099 LOCALLY FREE-TEXT CALL NUMBER (Insert in item record to display in catalog)</p>
<p>100 MAIN ENTRY – PERSONAL NAME (Required if present)
A personal name is the name of the person responsible for the creation of the intellectual or artistic content of an item as prominently displayed.  Use of this field relates to the statement of responsibility as found following title.  For an editor, use Marc tag 700 rather than this tag.  Do not use this tag for a corporation or organization given in statement of responsibility.  Just use title entry instead and trace corporate authors in 710. (Field 110 is used for Corporate Author main entry only if document is internal corporate document.)  It is best to match names to authority files already in use.  To do this, you can search the Sage, Summit or Library of Congress databases using the author search selection for the author listed in item being cataloged.  Then select one record by author and convert to a Marc Tag display.  Fill in spelling and dates given. Use subfield |a for name, subfield |q for expanded name, and subfield |d for date, if available.</p>
<p>This field may be used only once.  Additional authors go in 700 field.</p>
<pre><code>    |aCarroll, Lewis
    |aVan Buren, Martin,|d1850-1900.
    |aWhite, T. H.|q(Terence Hanbury),|d1906-1964.
    |aJohn|bXXXIII,|cPope,|d1881-1963.

subfield |c is preceded by a comma space 
subfield |d is preceded by a comma space
subfield |q is preceded by a space only and placed in parentheses
100 field ends with a mark of punctuation or a closing parenthesis “)”</p>
<p>110     This field is used for Corporate Author main entry only if document is internal corporate document. To trace a corporate entity otherwise related to the work, generally use 610 field if subject and 710 field if not.</p>
<p>245 TITLE STATEMENT (Required)
The title statement is the title proper and may also include a general material designation (form if other than book, i.e. [text (large print)]), subtitle, other title information, and the statement of responsibility (name of author or editor).  If you need to use a general material designation, use subfield |h after subfield |a.  A list of approved designations is included in Attachment 1.</p>
<pre><code>The first indicator should be 1 if MarcTag 100 (author) is used.  Otherwise use 0.
For second indicator use 0 if title does not begin with an article.  Use 1-9 to indicate an article, plus spaces, punctuation, diacritics and underscores that precede the first significant word.

For title use subfield |a 
    245 10 |aOrigins
    245 12  |aA field guide to wildflowers

<p>250 EDITION STATEMENT (Required if applicable)
Refer to the edition statement proper and any other information up to the imprint.  Use only if the edition statement is self-defining, that is uses words such as edition, issue, version.  Numbers may appear with an edition statement. For items that use revised alone use abbreviation Rev. as in example.  If you are aware that an item is a revision but is not shown in book, you may put Rev. in square brackets per example.  Use subfield |a for edition statement

<p>DATE
Use the publishing date and/or copyright date on the title or preliminary pages.  If there is more than a year’s difference between publishing and copyright date, both need to be added to the record, newest date first. Avoid using the printing date, which is used only in the complete absence of any other data or guess.    </p>
<pre><code>        Use subfield |c for date of publication
    |aSanta Ana, Calif. :|bDoubleday Multimedia,|c1973.

<p>300 PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ITEM (Required)
Use subfield |a for pagination. Enter data in terms of paging and/or number of volumes.  Pagination includes last printed page number in book.  Do not count any additional unnumbered pages, unless they contain material mentioned in subfield |b, such as maps.  If no pages are numbered, you may count and put number in brackets [35] p., estimate number of pages and precede number with ca. (for circa) or state (unpaged) in parentheses after number of unpaged volumes. If Arabic numbered pages begin with 1 and are preceded by Roman numbered pages, list both sequentially, otherwise ignore Roman numbered pages.</p>
<pre><code>    |a327 p.
    |a3 v.
    |a329 p., [4] leaves :|bmaps
    |a[35] p.
    |aca. 600 p.

</code></pre>
<p>These refer to abbreviations for illustrations, maps and portraits. Other allowable designations are listed in AACR2.  Do not make any up.</p>
<p>You may use col. to qualify any of above that are in color. If partially in color, follow designation with notation: (some col.)</p>
<pre><code>|avi, 221 p. :|bcol. ill.
    |a42 p. :|bill. maps (some col.)
</code></pre>
<p>Use subfield |c for dimensions, the size of the item such as height.  This is   measured in centimeters to the next whole centimeter up (e.g. if an item measures 17.2 centimeters, give as 18 cm.)  Any item that is wider than the height needs to have both dimensions with height listed first. </p>
<pre><code>    |a327 p. ;|c18 cm. 
    |axvi, 243 p. :|bill. ;|c10 x 12 cm.
</code></pre>
<p>Note: If cataloging using CIP (Cataloging in Publication) record from LC, you must fill in the physical description area and change 8 in the leader to a blank space [or in SuperCat to a . (period)].  (Refer to “Updating CIP Records” for additional instructions.)</p>
<p>Punctuation:<br />

    space semicolon space precedes subfield |c
    end 300 field with a period (usually already present) </p>
<p>440 SERIES STATEMENT  (Required if applicable)
Use for series statements to be traced by a series title.  A tracing refers to an access point in the catalog for the series title.  Look in Sage, Summit or Library of Congress databases under title to check for the correct form of the tracing (the authority record).  </p>
<p>(If you choose not to trace a series statement or to trace it differently use tag 490. A 490 tag is used if series author is listed or if entire series is known to be by the author of the book in hand.)</p>
<p>Use 440 tag if series does not list an exclusive author, e.g. the series is a publisher’s series and the series statement transcribed exactly as given on the resource matches the Library of Congress Authority file exactly..</p>
<pre><code>The first indicator is blank.
</code></pre>
<p>For second indicator use 0 if title does not begin with an article.  Use 1-9 to     indicate an article, plus spaces, punctuation, diacritics and underscores that  precede the first significant word.  </p>
<pre><code>Subfield |a contains the title portion of the series exclusive of any name, number of parts, volume numbering and ISSN.
    440  4  |aThe search series

<p>Use subfield |v for the volume number or other sequential designations used in conjunction with the series statement.  Use the 642 field in the Authority record to determine the format, ie: no.1 or #1
        |aThis is America ;|vno. 1</p>
<pre><code>Use subfield |x for ISSN number if available.  Subfield |x precedes subfield |v if present
|aEarth Science series,|x4522-1277 ;|vv. 12
</code></pre>
<p>490 SERIES STATEMENT (Required if applicable)
Use 490 first indicator 0 if you do not trace; 490 first indicator 1 if you trace
differently.  If you use a 490 1, an 800 field for the correct form of the tracing is required.  </p>
<pre><code>A first indicator of 0 indicates a series not traced.
Use subfield |a for author or title.
    490 0  |aNonesuch geographical studies

Use indicator 1 if series traced by author.  Then add Marc Tag 800 per example that follows:
    490 1  |aGellerman effective supervision studies
    800 1  |aGellerman, Paul.|tGellerman effective supervision studies ;|vno. 12.
</code></pre>
<p>Punctuation:<br />
No ending punctuation is added to 440 or 490 fields.
440 or 490 subfield |v is always preceded by space semicolon space
440 or 490 subfield |x is always preceded by a comma space</p>
<p>500 GENERAL NOTES (If Needed)

  Library of Congress (LC) subject headings.
</code></pre>
<p>This Marc tag needs to follow LC standards. Try finding a match from the Sage, Summit or Library of Congress databases. Enter names selected in the subject search in database. Try different selections until you find a possible fit.  Another way is to identify another book by the same author that has already been cataloged.  Look in the cataloged record for possible Subject Heading-Personal Name that would fit. When you have chosen a match, convert the catalog entry to a Marc Record. Enter into tag 600 exactly as you view in Marc format with the same indicators, and subfields.</p>
<p>650     SUBJECT ADDED ENTRY – TOPICAL TERM
Use for topical subject entry assigned by LC or assigned by an agency based on LC or LC Annotated Card Program (Subject Headings for Children’s Literature).  This Marc tag needs to follow LC standards. Try finding a match from the Sage, Summit or Library of Congress databases. Enter words related to the subject of the book with the Subject search.  Try different words till you find a fit.  Another way is to identify another book by the same author that is similar in content and has already been cataloged.  Search for title and see if subject headings used will fit your item.  Convert chosen record to Marc Record.  Enter Marc tag indicator numbers and subfields exactly as you view them.  </p>
<p>651 SUBJECT ADDED ENTRY – GEOGRAPHIC NAME
Use for geographic subject entries actually assigned by Library of Congress Subject Headings.  This would include place names such as Yellowstone National Park or Portland (Or.).  As above, would suggest searching Sage, Summit or Library of Congress databases. Search under Subject for geographic names.  If you find suitable subject entry, convert the entry to Marc Record and copy the indicators and subfields exactly as found.  </p>
<p>Punctuation: 
A period is placed at the end of the last subfield, unless it ends with a hyphen or parenthesis.
(The dashes normally shown preceding subfields v, x, y, and z are not carried in a MARC record. They are inserted by computer programs for public display of record.)</p>
<p>655 GENRE/FORM INDEX TERM (Optional)
This field contains a term indicating the genre, form or physical characteristic of a resource (what a resource is about).
First indicator is typically left blank; second indicator
Use 4 if the source is not specified (including local headings)
        655 _4 |aOregon authors.
Use 7 if the source is specified in |2
        655 _7 |aSuspense fiction.|2gsafd</p>
<p>Punctuation:<br />
Subfield |a is preceded by a period </p>
<p>700 ADDED ENTRY – PERSONAL NAME  (Added title optional)
Make an added personal name entry under the heading for a prominently named editor or compiler of monographic work.  Make an added personal name entry for an illustrator if the illustrations are considered to be an important feature of the work.  Make an added personal name entry for any other name that would provide an important access point not treated in another entry. It is best to match names to authority files already in use.  To do this, you can search the Sage, Summit, or Library of Congress databases. Using the author search selection choose the individual listed in item being cataloged.  Convert selected record to Marc Record and follow spelling and dates given there to fill in this Marc tag. </p>
<p>For first indicator, use 0 for a recognized forename such as Plato.  Use 1 for usual surname entries.  Use second indicator if adding a title, using 2.</p>
<p>Use subfield |a for name and use subfield |d for dates if known
    700 1   |aHemingway, Ernest,|d1899-1961.
    700 0   |aHomer.</p>
<p>Use subfield |t to add a title to this field which will be traced by author in the database.  <br />
    700 12  |aBeethoven, Ludwig van,|d1770-1827.|tC major symphony.</p>
<p>Punctuation:  End field with a period.</p>
<p>740 TITLE ADDED ENTRY (Optional)
Variant titles appear in field 246.
Use for tracing specific titles in 505 contents note.

= <em>Monograph Parts 2.1</em></p>
<p>This feature will be available in Evergreen version 2.1.</p>
<p><em>Abstract</em></p>
<p><em>Monograph Parts</em> enables you to differentiate between parts of monographs or other multi-part items.  This feature enables catalogers to describe items more precisely by labeling the parts of an item.  For example, catalogers might identify the parts of a monograph or the discs of a DVD set.  This feature also allows patrons more flexibility when placing holds on multi-part items.  A patron could place a hold on a specific disc of a DVD set if they want to access a specific season or episode rather than an entire series.</p>
<p>Four new permissions are used by this functionality: CREATE_MONOGRAPH_PART, UPDATE_MONOGRAPH_PART, DELETE_MONOGRAPH_PART and MAP_MONOGRAPH_PART.  These permissions should be assigned at the consortial level to those groups or users that will make use of the features described below.</p>

MARC fields for RDA material description (vs. GMD)
NOTE: The general material designation (GMD) is expressed in MARC for AACR2r as 245 $h.  MARC for RDA replaces this subfield with a “triple” of fields (336/7/8) identifying content, media format and carrier or physical format of the cataloged item.  This allows the given work to be distinguished by the RDA categories of “expression” and “manifestation” in catalog search with greater precision than before.   These fields can be repeated to describe multi-format items (e.g. kits) – and individually repeated for complex description (see “Video Game” below).
It is the policy of the Sage Cataloging Committee to retain subfield 245 $h where found as an aid to patrons, and to create/populate field 999 based on its value or the values of fields 336/7/8, as available. </p>
<p>Book or Magazine (N.B. Large Print, Juvenile, etc. not distinguished):
=336 \$a text $2 rdacontent
=337 \$a unmediated $2 rdamedia
=338 \$a volume $2 rdacarrier</p>
<p>Audiobook (CD):
=336 \$a spoken word $2 rdacontent
=337 \$a audio $2 rdamedia
=338 \$a audio disc $2 rdacarrier</p>
<p>Audiobook (Cassette tape):
=336 \$a spoken word $2 rdacontent
=337 \$a audio $2 rdamedia
=338 \$a audio cassette $2 rdacarrier</p>
<p>Recorded Music (CD):
=336 \$a performed music  $2 rdacontent
=337 \ $a audio $2 rdamedia
=338 \$a audio disc $2 rdacarrier</p>
<p>DVD or Blu-Ray Video (n.b. not distinguished):
=336 \ $a two-dimensional moving image $2 rdacontent
=337 \$a video $2 rdamedia
=338 \$a videodisc $2 rdacarrier</p>
<p>VHS Video:
=336 \ $a two-dimensional moving image $2 rdacontent
=337 \$a video $2 rdamedia
=338 \$a video cassette $2 rdacarrier</p>
<p>E-book or Web site (e.g. OverDrive title):
=336 \$a text $2 rdacontent
=337 \$a computer $2 rdamedia
=338 \$a online resource $2 rdacarrier</p>
<p>Computer Disc (CD-ROM)
=336 \$a text $2 rdacontent
=337 \$a computer $2 rdamedia
=338 \$a  computer disc $2rdacarrier</p>
<p>Video Game:
=336 \$a two-dimensional moving image  $2 rdacontent
=336 \$a computer program $2 rdacontent
=337 \$a computer $2 rdamedia
=338 \$a computer disc $2 rdacarrier</p>
<p>It can be seen that by using appropriate values in these fields, a wide range of “material types” (AACR2r) can be established (e.g. “Recorded Music – Cassette” substitutes “audio cassette” in 338 $a).  These values for $a are drawn from controlled vocabularies, which can be found at the following links:
•   RDA Content Terms (336 $a): http://www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/rdacontent.html
•   RDA Media Terms (337 $a): http://www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/rdamedia.html
•   RDA Carrier Terms (338 $a): http://www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/rdacarrier.html</p>

Serials</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Search your bibliographic utility for the serial.  Seldom will you have to edit a serials record, as they are open ended so have no pagination information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be sure that the record is in fact a serial.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>a.  The record may contain an 022 field, the ISSN number, indicating beyond a doubt that the record is a serial.
b.  If you search by title, such as Fodor’s China, you will find a serials record without an ISSN.  The book in hand has an ISBN, and the record has no ISSN, but other clues indicate that this is indeed a serial.
c.  A serials record is open ended.  There will be no pagination or publication date,  there will be a 222 field indicating the unique title assigned by the ISSN national center, and there will usually be information about frequency of publication,  previous editions, and previous publishers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do not assume that because a book has regular updates that it is a serial.  For example, Moon Travel Guides publishes frequent editions, but these are not considered to be a serials.  Use the other clues.  Cataloging with AACR2 and USMARC provides detailed instruction for matching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you cannot verify by either ISSN or other sources (Library of Congress, ORBIS, etc.) that your item is in fact a serial, it is recommended that you catalog as if it is a monograph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some cases you will assume the record is a serial even without the verification.  This happens with the Fodor’s travel guides.  All Fodor’s travel guides are considered to be serials, but you may not be able to find an existing record for the particular country in question.  For example, Fodor’s Turkey does not have a record in the Library of Congress, but since all other Fodor’s are serials you can assume that this one is, too.  In this case you should create an original record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is beyond the scope of this document to detail the original cataloging of serials.  If you need guidance, contact a member of the Cataloging Committee.</p>

RECOMMENDED STANDARDS FOR BIBLIOGRAPHIC RECORDS – SPECIFIC TO SOUND RECORDINGS
Developed by Cataloging Committee, 2004</p>
<p>Notes:<br />
1) The chief sources of information for each field for sound recordings records are listed in AACR2R. The chief source of information for each major type of sound recording  is set out here. 
        TYPE                    CHIEF SOURCE
        Disc                    Disc and label<em>
Tape (open reel-to-reel)        Reel and label
Tape cassette               Cassette and label
Tape cartridge              Cartridge and label
Roll                    Label
</em>Label means any permanently affixed paper, plastic, etc. label as opposed to the container itself, which may have data embossed or printed on it.
Treat accompanying textual material or a container as the chief source of information if
it furnishes a collective title and the parts themselves and their labels do not.  In this 
case make a note indicating the chief source of information.  If information is not 
available from the chief source, take it from the following sources (in order of 
preference):
accompanying textual material
container (e.g. sleeve, box)
other sources
Prefer textual data to sound data.  For example, if a sound disc has a label and also 
information presented in sound form on the disc, prefer the label information. </p>
<p>The prescribed source(s) of information for each area of the description of sound 
recordings is set out below.  Enclose information taken from outside the prescribed 
source(s) in square brackets.
    AREA                    PRESCRIBED SOURCES OF INFORMATION
    Title and statement of responsibility   Chief source of information
    Edition                 Chief source of information, accompanying
textual material, container
    Publication, distribution, etc.     Chief source of information, accompanying
textual material, container
        Physical description            Any source
    Series                  Chief source of information, accompanying
textual material, container
        Note                    Any source
        Standard number &amp; terms of      Any source
            availability
2) Although shown for clarity, subfield |a sometimes does not show on MARC record in initial instance of use. 
3) Some subfields are repeatable and some are not. Check AACR2R if in doubt.</p>
<p>4) Colon space and Semicolon space precede some fields and are required formatting.
5) In some cataloging utilities subfield delimiters take the place of spaces when shown and additional spaces to meet AACR2R requirements should not be added; in other words, without subfields the space it occupied remains in the visible record.  (This is how the Pioneer Library System automation handles this and so the examples throughout this document follow this principle.)  OCLC records are an exception: when the subfield delimiters are suppressed in the display they do not leave the space they occupied behind.<br />
For example,  300 p. :|bill. ;|c25 cm. and  300 p. : |bill. ; |c25 cm. (OCLC) 
would both display as  300 p. : ill. ; 25 cm.<br />
Check out your own utility to see how they handle this.
6) The symbol | (pipe) represents the subfield delimiter in these standards. In OCLC records you see the symbol $ (dollar sign).</p>
<p>020 ISBN NUMBER (Optional)    <br />
An ISBN is a unique number assigned to an item by its publisher.  Each ISBN number is a ten-digit number and has four parts.  Enter without hyphens and add any qualifiers that describe the item.
        |a1590868188
        |a1559351500 (set)</p>
<p>Note:  Although this number is supposed to be unique, it often is not, so caution should be exercised in using this as a match point.</p>
<p>024 OTHER STANDARD IDENTIFIER (Optional)
    A standard number or code published on an item which cannot be accommodated in 
    another field.  The type of standard number or code is identified in the first indicator 
    position or in subfield |2 (Source of number or code).</p>
<pre><code>1st indicator – Type of standard number or code
    0 – International Standard Recording Code (ISRC)    
    1 – Universal Product Code (UPC)
    2 – International Standard Music Number (ISMN)
    3 – International Article Number (EAN)
    4 – Serial Item and Contribution Identifier (SICI)
    7 – Source specified in subfield |2
    8 – Unspecified type of standard number or code
2nd indicator – Difference indicator
    blank – No information provided
    0 – No difference
    1 – Difference
Subfield Codes:
    |a – Standard number or code
    |c – Terms of availability
    |d – Additional codes following the standard number or code
    |z – Canceled/invalid standard number or code
    |2 – Source of number or code

    024 1_ |a5794368779
    024 3_ |a9781578155293
    024 3_ |a9780553528152|d52595
</code></pre>
<p>028 PUBLISHER NUMBER (Optional)
    The formatted number used for sound recordings, printed music, and videorecordings. 
Publisher’s numbers that are given in an unformatted form are recorded in field 500
(General Note).  A print constant identifying the kind of publisher number may be 
generated based on the value in the first indicator position.</p>
<p>1st indicator –                     2nd indicator –
Type of publisher number            Note/added entry controller

</code></pre>
<p>040 CATALOGING SOURCE (Required)
Original source of the cataloging data (subfield |a), contributor of cataloging data, and if applicable, the modifier of cataloging data (subfield |d).  Use OCLC or USMARC code that uniquely identifies your location.  (See OCLC code list).  For example:
        |aOXU 
        |aUMT   |dLGRND</p>
<p>092 LOCALLY ASSIGNED DEWEY CALL NUMBER (Optional - This field does not show up on database)
Call numbers based on Dewey Decimal Classification.  </p>
<p>099 LOCALLY FREE-TEXT CALL NUMBER (Optional - This field does not show up on database)</p>
<p>100 MAIN ENTRY – PERSONAL NAME (Required if present)
A personal name is the name of the person responsible for the creation of the intellectual or artistic content of an item as prominently displayed.  Use of this field relates to the statement of responsibility as found following title.  For an editor, use Marc tag 700 rather than this tag.  Do not use this tag for a corporation or organization given in statement of responsibility.  Just use title entry instead and trace corporate authors in 710. It is best to match names to authority files already in use.  To do this, you can search the Pioneer, Orbis or Library of Congress databases using the author search selection for the author listed in item being cataloged.  Then select one record by author and convert to a Marc Tag display.  Fill in spelling and dates given. Use subfield |a for name, subfield |q for expanded name, and subfield |d for date, if available.</p>
<p>This field may be used only once.  Additional authors go in 700 field.</p>
<pre><code>    |aGrisham, John.
    |aBradbury, Ray,|d1920-
    |aLewis, C. S.|q(Clive Staples),|d1893-1963.
    |aJohn Paul|bII,|cPope,|d1920-

Punctuation:
</code></pre>
<p>Subfield |b is preceded by a space only
subfield |c is preceded by a comma space 
subfield |d is preceded by a comma space
subfield |q is preceded by a space only and placed in parentheses
100 field ends with a mark of punctuation or a closing parenthesis “)”</p>
<p>245 TITLE STATEMENT (Required)
The title statement is the title proper and may also include a general material designation (form if other than book, i.e. sound recording), subtitle, other title information, and the statement of responsibility (name of author or editor).  If you need to use a general material designation, use subfield |h after subfield |a.  A list of approved designations is included in Attachment 1 of “Recommended Standards for Bibliographic Records: Developed by Cataloging Work Team, 2002.”</p>
<pre><code>The first indicator should be 1 if MarcTag 100 (author) is used.  Otherwise use 0.
For second indicator use 0 if title does not begin with an article.  Use 1-9 to indicate an article, plus spaces, punctuation, diacritics and underscores that precede the first significant word.

For general material designation (GMD) use subfield |h.  
    245 10 |aEight cousins|h[sound recording]
    245 14 |aThe sounds of Christmas|h[sound recording]
For the subtitle use |b
    245 04 The Civil War|h[sound recording] :|bits music and its sounds

Note:   Subfield |b follows subfield |h.

For statement of responsibility (name of author or editor or corporation) use subfield |c.
</code></pre>
<p>Transcribe statements of responsibility relating to those persons or bodies credited with a 
major role in creating the intellectual content of the sound recording (e.g., as writers of
spoken words, composers of performed music, collectors of field material, producers 
having artistic and/or intellectual responsibility) in the form in which they appear.  If the 
participation of the person(s) or body (bodies) named in a statement found in the chief 
source of information goes beyond that of performance, execution, or interpretation of a 
work (as is commonly the case with “popular,” rock, and jazz music), give such a 
statement as a statement of responsibility.  If however, the participation is confined to 
performance, execution, or interpretation (as is commonly the case with “serious” or 
classical music and recorded speech), give the statement in the note area.</p>
<p>Add a word or short phrase to the statement of responsibility, in brackets, if the 
relationship between the title and the person(s) or body (bodies) named in the statement is 
not clear. </p>
<p>245 14 |aThe land that time forgot|h[sound recording] /|cby Edgar Rice 
Burroughs.
        245 10 |aEndurance|h[sound recording] :|bShackleton’s incredible voyage /|cby

        245 10 |aBorn to run|h[sound recording] /|c[written and performed by] Bruce 
            Springsteen.</p>
<pre><code>Note:  Subfield |c follows subfield |h.
</code></pre>
<p>Punctuation: 
subfield |b is preceded by space colon space

<pre><code>The first indicator is 1 for a single surname and 3 for a family name  The second       indicator refers to subject authority on which you base the subject entry.  Use 0 for
  Library of Congress (LC) subject headings.
</code></pre>
<p>This Marc tag needs to follow LC standards. Try finding a match from the Pioneer, Orbis or Library of Congress databases. Enter names selected in the subject search in database. Try different selections until you find a possible fit.  Another way is to identify another book by the same author that has already been cataloged.  Look in the cataloged record for possible Subject Heading-Personal Name that would fit. When you have chosen a match, convert the catalog entry to a Marc Record. Enter into tag 600 exactly as you view in Marc format with the same indicators, and subfields.</p>
<p>650     SUBJECT ADDED ENTRY – TOPICAL TERM
Use for topical subject entry assigned by LC or assigned by an agency based on LC or LC Annotated Card Program (Subject Headings for Children’s Literature).  This Marc tag needs to follow LC standards. Try finding a match from the Pioneer, Orbis or Library of Congress databases. Enter words related to the subject of the book with the Subject search.  Try different words till you find a fit.  Another way is to identify another book by the same author that is similar in content and has already been cataloged.  Search for title and see if subject headings used will fit your item.  Convert chosen record to Marc Record.  Enter Marc tag indicator numbers and subfields exactly as you view them.  </p>
<p>651 SUBJECT ADDED ENTRY – GEOGRAPHIC NAME
Use for geographic subject entries actually assigned by Library of Congress Subject Headings.  This would include place names such as Yellowstone National Park or Portland (Or.).  As above, would suggest searching Pioneer, Orbis or Library of Congress databases. Search under Subject for geographic names.  If you find suitable subject entry, convert the entry to Marc Record and copy the indicators and subfields exactly as found.  </p>
<p>Punctuation: 
A period is placed at the end of the last subfield, unless it ends with a hyphen or parenthesis.
(The dashes normally shown preceding subfields v, x, y, and z are not carried in a MARC record. They are inserted by computer programs for public display of record.)</p>
<p>700 ADDED ENTRY – PERSONAL NAME  (Added title optional)
Make an added personal name entry under the heading for a prominently named editor or compiler of monographic work.  Make an added personal name entry for an illustrator if the illustrations are considered to be an important feature of the work.  Make an added personal name entry for any other name that would provide an important access point not treated in another entry. It is best to match names to authority files already in use.  To do this, you can search the Pioneer, Orbis, or Library of Congress databases. Using the author search selection choose the individual listed in item being cataloged.  Convert selected record to Marc Record and follow spelling and dates given there to fill in this Marc tag. </p>
<p>For first indicator, use 0 for a recognized forename such as Plato.  Use 1 for usual surname entries.  Use second indicator if adding a title, using 2.</p>
<p>Use subfield |a for name and use subfield |d for dates if known

<p>800 SERIES ADDED ENTRY – PERSONAL NAME/TITLE (Required if 490 1  field present)
This field is used when all books in a series are written by the same author. <br />
Follow all rules for entry of author in 100 field.
Title is added in subfield |t.  (It will be traced in online catalog).
If volume number is present it is added in subfield |v.</p>
